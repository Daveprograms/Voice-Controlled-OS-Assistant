Milestone 1: Voice to Text

Technical Goal: Input a recorded file and output text to the terminal using TBD technology.
Actions: Create test cases with 2 recordings.
Milestone 2: Record Capability

Technical Goal: Develop a script to start a 5-second recording and output a recorded file.
Milestone 3: Integration of Recording and Text Output

Combine the capabilities of Milestones 1 and 2 to send a recording and receive text output. This also involves testing each milestone to identify and resolve any issues.
Milestone 4 and 5: Email Integration

Choose between developing a script to send emails or to take in text and output an email. This decision impacts the direction for Milestone 6.
Milestone 6: Combining Milestones 4 and 5

Milestone 7: Integration with Milestone 3

Combine the functionalities developed in previous milestones for a cohesive operation.
Milestone 8: Web Server Setup

Set up an HTTP server to serve a static HTML page, listening on port 3000. This is the foundation for web interaction.
Milestone 9: Record Creation on Static Page

Enable users to create voice recordings directly on the served web page.
Milestone 10: Capture Recording from Browser

Implement a new route (e.g., /record) to capture audio stream data from the browser to a file.
Milestone 11: Integration of Web Recording with Backend Processing

Combine web recording capabilities with the backend processing established in previous milestones.
Milestone 12: Backend Processing of Recordings

Focus on processing the input recording to output text on the backend side.
Milestone 13: Real-time Audio Streaming

Implement a real-time data stream from the frontend to the backend, likely using websockets, to facilitate live voice to text conversion.
Milestone 14: Streaming Text-to-Speech

Explore text-to-speech capabilities using external APIs such as OpenAI's GPT or Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text services.
Milestone 15: Display Generated Text in Browser

Show the text generated from speech in the web browser, completing the loop for a speech-to-text application.
